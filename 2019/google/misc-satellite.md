# Satellite
## Description
> Placing your ship in range of the Osmiums, you begin to receive signals. Hoping that you are not detected, because it's too late now, you figure that it may be worth finding out what these signals mean and what information might be "borrowed" from them. Can you hear me Captain Tim? Floating in your tin can there? Your tin can has a wire to ground control? Find something to do that isn't staring at the Blue Planet.

There doesn't appear to be any username / password prompt for the binary. Our next step should be to use Wireshark to sniff the packets when running the binary. We're assuming that the program will make a connection to a remote server either through its domain name or IP address. The Wireshark traffic shows a DNS request to
`satellite.ctfcompetition.com`. This domain name resolves to `34.76.101.29`. We can now filter the traffic by `ip.addr == 34.76.101.29`. If we right-click and select `Follow -> TCP Stream`, then we see the following
